# Welcome to my personal portfolio react project!


## Intro
This project is intended to create a single page portfolio to provide both links to my Github account and my LinkedIn profile. The essential aspect of this project is to demonstrate my web development knowledge and skills.

My goal is to create a React app, host it on Heroku, source control it using Github and touch as many web tools and frameworks as I find interesting.

The project will be simple as it's final result but will cover some interesting topics.

This readme me file will be used to describe the project, it's progress, and a simple and funny backlog-ticketing system.

I hope you enjoy it!
